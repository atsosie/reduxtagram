# REDUXTAGRAM

A simple React + Redux implementation. This app was developed for practice/educational purposes.
I followed the free video series by Wes Bos, using the starter files provided at LearnRedux.com.
The app is still in development, and the code is full of notes I included to help me understand
everything.

# Mini Review of the Learn Redux tutorial:

This tutorial has been really helpful and easy to follow. I recommend it for those wanting to
learn Redux, especially "beginner" developers. Wes describes things clearly (although quickly -
you may need to rewind a lot or watch at .75 speed). He also explains things like why a certain
syntax is used, what different chunks of code are doing, how to break a task up into smaller
tasks when implementing a feature, and how to use different debugging tools.

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies.

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:7770> in your browser.

## Production Build

Run `npm build` to create a distro folder and a bundle.js file.
